BlazeDemo Flight Booking – Manual Testing Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is a self-made manual testing project conducted on the BlazeDemo demo flight booking website.
The aim is to perform manual functional testing on the flight booking process and simulate real-world QA activities, including test planning, test case design, execution, and defect reporting.

This project showcases my ability to design detailed test cases, identify defects, and maintain professional QA documentation.

🎯 Objective
To validate the core functionalities of the BlazeDemo flight booking application by testing end-to-end booking flows and ensuring the system works as expected for both positive and negative scenarios.
